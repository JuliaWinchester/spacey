Between the oppressive Empire and the idealistic but probably doomed Rebel Alliance, there is opportunity out there among the stars for scoundrels who are clever enough to find it and wise enough to choose exactly the right laws to break. Fortune and glory await!<br><br>Of course, if you hope to be able to sleep at night, your job as a career criminal becomes that much harder. You can't make a hyperspace jump without meeting a person in need or a cause worth getting mixed up in. But you've got debts to pay, and the ship always needs fueling, and maybe a vicious Hutt gangster has decided that you're an employee for life, whether you like it or not. So many choices, what's an honest thief to do?",
